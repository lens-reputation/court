## LensCourt Whitepaper

### A Decentralized Protocol for On-Chain Judgment and Human Reputation Verification

---

### 1. Introduction

In a social network powered by decentralization and verified activity, reputation is everything. **LensCourt** introduces a complementary layer to the Lens ecosystem and the **LensReputation** protocol: a **community-curated reputation court** that transforms data into collective trust — with human context.

While LensReputation provides the foundation through algorithmically calculated scores based on on-chain and social data, LensCourt adds **human verification**: a peer-reviewed system that allows the most reputable users to vote on the authenticity, consistency, and trustworthiness of profiles within the Lens Network.

### 2. Vision

> Reputation is power. Score is law.

LensCourt seeks to create the first decentralized social court of Web3 — a system where only the most reputable users gain the right to become judges and help curate what counts as trustworthy, active, and valuable participation in the Lens ecosystem.

Our ultimate goal is to build:

- A **human-curated reputation layer**, backed by data and governed by merit.
- A **governance system** that evolves through community decisions.
- A **signal amplifier** to enrich LensReputation with peer review.

### 3. Core Mechanics

#### 3.1 Reputation Score (via LensReputation)

Every profile on Lens gets a dynamic **Reputation Score**, calculated through the LensReputation protocol, combining:

- Protocol activity (posts, followers, Lens Handle, account age).
- On-chain interactions (transactions, volume, contract usage).
- Financial signals (balance, token diversity, fee payments).
- Weekly consistency and time-weighted factors.

This score is public and defines a user’s eligibility and influence within LensCourt.

#### 3.2 Judge Selection

- Only **users with a score above 600** (from LensReputation) can access a **Judge Seat**.
- Seats can be purchased for **\$10**, acting as an access mechanism.
- Seats are minted as NFTs and can be **resold via auction**.
- All Judge NFTs are tradable through a dedicated LensCourt auction contract (5% fee on resales).

#### 3.3 Curation & Voting

- Judges can **review profiles** in daily batches (10 per day max, enforced via cooldown).
- Judges cast **positive or negative votes** on profiles.
- Each vote is weighted by the **Judge's Reputation Score** (via LensReputation).
- Voting data is stored on Lens as publications, making it fully transparent and queryable.
- Any user can access LensCourt reviews by changing a profile URL:
  `heyy.xyz/u/meketom` → `lenscourt.xyz/u/meketom`

#### 3.4 Governance

- Judge Seat holders participate in **protocol governance**.
- They can vote on changes, upgrades, scoring mechanics, and special cases.
- Future incentives and penalties will be handled via decentralized governance.

### 4. Utility & Incentives

LensCourt transforms being a judge into a **merit-based privilege**:

- Only the most reputable can become judges — it’s not a right, it’s earned.
- Judges gain the **power to vote** on whether other accounts are bots or real, suspicious or trusted.
- Judges can **auction** the Judge Seat NFTs they own — their role has market value.
- All votes are public and signal trust or distrust to the rest of the network.
- Judges get a **voice in governance** — helping shape how LensCourt evolves.
- The more reputable you are, the more your vote weighs.
- You actively **contribute to cleaning the network**, identifying bots, and supporting real users and creators.
- Being a judge boosts your standing across the ecosystem and may grant early access to future rewards or roles.

In short: to be a judge is to be trusted, visible, and powerful.

### 5. Open Human Verification Layer

LensCourt creates a novel interaction layer that complements the LensReputation score:

- Adds **human insight** and **social consensus** to raw data.
- Positive and negative votes serve as **community endorsements or warnings**.

- Projects can **integrate LensCourt signals** to enhance trust assessments.
- It builds a **transparent, user-owned trust layer** for all of Lens.

### 6. Conclusion

Powered by LensReputation scores and governed by its most reputable users, LensCourt transforms passive data into **verified social capital**.
