## LensCourt Whitepaper

### A Decentralized Protocol for On-Chain Judgment and Human Reputation Verification

---

### 1. Introduction

In a social network powered by decentralization and verified activity, reputation is everything. **LensCourt** introduces a complementary layer to the Lens ecosystem and the **LensReputation** protocol: a **community-curated reputation court** that transforms data into collective trust — with human context.

While LensReputation provides the foundation through algorithmically calculated scores based on on-chain and social data, LensCourt adds **human verification**: a peer-reviewed system that allows the most reputable users to vote on the authenticity, consistency, and trustworthiness of profiles within the Lens Network.

### 2. Vision

> Reputation is power. Score is law.

LensCourt seeks to create the first decentralized social court of Web3 — a system where only the most reputable users gain the right to become judges and help curate what counts as trustworthy, active, and valuable participation in the Lens ecosystem.

Our ultimate goal is to build:

* A **human-curated reputation layer**, backed by data and governed by merit.
* A **governance system** that evolves through community decisions.
* A **signal amplifier** to enrich LensReputation with peer review.

### 3. Core Mechanics

#### 3.1 Reputation Score (via LensReputation)

Every account can get a dynamic **Reputation Score**, calculated through the LensReputation protocol, combining:

* Protocol activity.
* On-chain interactions.
* Financial signals.
* Weekly consistency and time-weighted factors.

This score is public and defines a user’s eligibility and influence within LensCourt.

#### 3.2 Judge Selection

* Only profiles with a **LensReputation Score above 600** are eligible to access a **Judge Seat**.
* Eligibility is merit-based: only active, reputable users can take part.
* A one-time fee of **\$10** is required to claim a seat.
* Judge Seats are issued as **soulbound NFTs** (non-transferable).
* Judge Seats can be **auctioned** so that other accounts may buy them.
* A **5% fee** from these auctions will go to the protocol.

#### 3.3 Curation & Voting

* Judges can **review profiles** in daily batches (10 per day max, enforced via cooldown).
* Judges cast **positive or negative votes** on profiles.
* Each vote is weighted by the **Judge's Reputation Score** (via LensReputation).
* Voting data is stored on Lens as publications, making it fully transparent and queryable.
* Any user can access LensCourt reviews by changing a profile URL:
  `heyy.xyz/u/tomeke` → `lenscourt.xyz/u/tomeke`

#### 3.4 Governance

* Judge Seat holders participate in **protocol governance**.
* They can vote on changes, upgrades, scoring mechanics, and special cases.
* Future incentives and penalties will be handled via decentralized governance.

---

### 4. Utility & Incentives

* Being a Judge is a **privilege and status symbol** in the Lens ecosystem.
* Judges can vote on whether accounts appear to be bots or trustworthy human users.
* They help **flag suspicious behavior**, and their votes shape the social consensus.
* Judge Seats are a **mark of verified reputation** and grant voting power within the protocol.
* Judge Seats may be auctioned, creating a **market-driven value** with protocol sustainability via fees.
* Projects and users can use **vote-weighted reputation insights** to evaluate profiles.

---

### 5. Open Human Verification Layer

LensCourt creates a novel interaction layer that complements the LensReputation score:

* Adds **human insight** and **social consensus** to raw data.
* Positive and negative votes serve as **community endorsements or warnings**.
* Reviews are tied to **Lens profiles** and visible across any dApp that integrates the protocol.
* Projects can **integrate LensCourt signals** to enhance trust assessments.
* It builds a **transparent, user-owned trust layer** for all of Lens.

### 6. Conclusion

LensCourt introduces the first decentralized reputation court for Lens. It’s not a leaderboard — it’s a **social protocol for merit, trust, and human judgment**. Powered by LensReputation scores and governed by its most reputable users, LensCourt transforms passive data into **verified social capital**.
