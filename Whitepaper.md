## LensCourt Whitepaper

### A Decentralized Protocol for On-Chain Judgment and Human Reputation Verification

---

### 1. Introduction

In a social network powered by decentralization and verified activity, reputation is everything. **LensCourt** introduces a complementary layer to the Lens ecosystem and the **LensReputation** protocol: a **community-curated reputation court** that transforms data into collective trust — with human context.

While LensReputation provides the foundation through algorithmically calculated scores based on on-chain and social data, LensCourt adds **human verification**: a peer-reviewed system that allows the most reputable users to vote on the authenticity, consistency, and trustworthiness of accounts within the Lens Network.

### 2. Vision

> Reputation is power. Score is law.

LensCourt aims to create the first decentralized social court of Web3, where only the most reputable users gain the right to become judges. These judges help curate what counts as trustworthy, active, and valuable participation in the Lens ecosystem.

Our ultimate goal is to build a human-curated reputation layer backed by data and governed by merit. LensCourt is also a governance system that evolves through community decisions and acts as a signal amplifier to enrich LensReputation with peer review.

### 3. Core Mechanics

LensCourt operates as a protocol that builds on the LensReputation score, adding an extra layer of judgment, accountability, and community-driven trust.

Users can mint a dynamic **Reputation Score** through LensReputation. This score is calculated based on a combination of protocol activity, on-chain interactions, financial behavior, and time-weighted consistency. It determines each user’s eligibility and weight in the LensCourt system.

Those who achieve a score above **600** are eligible to mint a **Judge Seat**, after paying a one-time fee of **\$10**. Judge Seats are issued as **soulbound NFTs**, symbolizing access and authority. Although soulbound and non-transferable in traditional terms, these seats can be **auctioned**, allowing other accounts to obtain them. Auctions include a **5% fee** that is redirected to the protocol.

Judges participate in daily curation tasks, where they can review up to 10 accounts per day. They cast either a positive or negative vote based on the perceived authenticity and trustworthiness of the account. Each vote is **weighted** by the judge’s own Reputation Score. Voting data is recorded transparently on Lens as account action.

Judge Seats also grant **governance rights**. Seat holders are empowered to vote on protocol upgrades, changes in the scoring mechanics, and proposals regarding incentive mechanisms or penalties. Governance is designed to be progressive, evolving with the needs of the community.

### 4. Utility & Incentives

Being a Judge is not just a role — it's a social distinction in the Lens ecosystem. Judges help detect bots, highlight suspicious behaviors, and elevate trustworthy accounts. They play a critical role in shaping the network's consensus on what constitutes a reputable user.

Judge Seats act as a **mark of verified reputation**, signaling earned influence and enabling voting within the protocol. Additionally, developers and users can leverage the LensCourt signals — filtered through vote weight and human consensus — to evaluate accounts across dApps.

---

### 5. Open Human Verification Layer

LensCourt creates a new interaction layer that brings human context to decentralized data. It supplements algorithmic scores with real human votes. Positive and negative votes function as collective endorsements or warnings.

Each review is attached to a Lens account and visible across any dApp that integrates with LensCourt. By combining transparent, decentralized storage with open access, LensCourt enables developers and communities to integrate its reputation data into broader trust frameworks.

This results in a user-owned trust layer that lives across the Lens ecosystem.

---

### 6. Roadmap

LensCourt is structured into several progressive phases:

* **Phase 1**: Judge minting seats period open.
* **Phase 2**: Launch of the Judge Review Panel and account curation interface and integration with Lens Reputation.
* **Phase 3**: Activation of the voting engine with score-weighted votes.
* **Phase 4**: Deployment of the governance module and the auction mechanism for seats, including the 5% fee to the protocol.
* **Phase 5**: Ecosystem integrations and launch of a public API for external access to the Human Reputation Layer.

### 7. Conclusion

LensCourt introduces the first decentralized reputation court for Lens. It is not a leaderboard, but a **social protocol grounded in merit, trust, and peer evaluation**. With algorithmic backing from LensReputation and human governance from Judge Seats, LensCourt turns passive data into verified social capital.

Will you judge — or be judged?
